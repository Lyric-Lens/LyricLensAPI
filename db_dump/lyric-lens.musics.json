  "interpretation": "The lyrics portray a relentless and overwhelming sales pitch from a cunning salesperson, exploiting the desires and vulnerabilities of the listener. The salesperson employs an aggressive and manipulative tone, tempting the listener with irresistible offers and a sense of urgency. However, beneath the enticing surface, there's a sinister undercurrent, hinting at the potential consequences of falling prey to the salesperson's schemes. The lyrics serve as a cautionary tale against impulsive purchasing and the dangers of being swayed by persuasive marketing tactics.",

  "interpretation": "The song depicts a defiant and enigmatic figure who embodies revolution and seeks retribution against oppressive forces. They stand alone, unaligned with any side, and their actions are driven by a deep sense of injustice and a desire to challenge the established order. Their words and actions strike fear into the hearts of those who oppose them, leaving a lasting mark on the world and leaving listeners with a chilling reminder of the power of rebellion.",
